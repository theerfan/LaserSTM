## Create a scheduler

The scheduler behaves differently depending on whether you're using the model for training or inference. During inference, the scheduler generates image from the noise. During training, the scheduler takes a model output - or a sample - from a specific point in the diffusion process and applies noise to the image according to a *noise schedule* and an *update rule*.

Let's take a look at the [DDPMScheduler](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/schedulers/ddpm#diffusers.DDPMScheduler) and use the `add_noise` method to add some random noise to the `sample_image` from before:

The training objective of the model is to predict the noise added to the image. The loss at this step can be calculated by:
"""

import torch.nn.functional as F

noise_pred = model(noisy_image, timesteps).sample
loss = F.mse_loss(noise_pred, noise)

"""## Train the model

By now, you have most of the pieces to start training the model and all that's left is putting everything together.

* [DreamBooth](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/tutorials/../training/dreambooth), a technique for generating personalized images of a subject given several input images of the subject.
* [Guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/tutorials/../training/text2image) to finetuning a Stable Diffusion model on your own dataset.
